Build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

You have to load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

    k-Nearest Neighbour
    Decision Tree
    Support Vector Machine
    Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

    Jaccard index
    F1-score
    LogLoass
